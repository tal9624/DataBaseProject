dancing\nAnd then to church on Sundays\nTo plant more dreams\nAnd some day think of kids\nOr maybe just to save a little money\n\nCHORUS:\nYou're the one I need\nThe way back home is always long\nBut if you're close to me\nI'm holding on\nYou're the one I need\nMy real life has just begun\nCause there's nothing like\nYour smile made of sun\n\nIn a world full of strangers\nYou're the one I know\n\nSo I learn to cook\nAnd finally lose my kitchen phobia\nSo I've got the arms to cuddle in\nWhen there's a ghost or a muse\nthat brings insomnia\n\nTo buy more thongs,\nAnd write more happy songs\nIt always takes a little help from someone\n\nCHORUS 2 times\n\nYou're the one I need\nYou're the one I need\nWith you my real life has just begun\nYou're the one I need\nYou're the one I

used to climb my door\nFalling back down to the floor\nI used to read survival guides\nWhen my world was full of seven legged cats\nBut here I am with eight more lives\n\nI'm ready for the good times\nI'm ready for the good times\nReady to get it on\nI'm ready for the good times\nI'm ready for the good times\nNow that I'm not alone\nOh Oh Oh Oh\nOh Oh Oh Oh\nOh Oh Oh Oh\nYou know it\nOh Oh Oh Oh\nOh Oh Oh Oh\nYou better not\nIgnore it\n\nI don't wanna look at fashion magazines\nWhile someone does my nails\nSitting here watching other people live\nFrozen by the fear to fail\nCause, everyday there's a war to fight\nAnd if I win or lose, nevermind\nAs long as you're my shelter every night\nI used to cry against a wall\nBut now I've got a shoulder that I can lean on\nSwear to me you won't be gone\n\nI'm ready for the good times\nI'm ready for the good times\nReady to get it on\nI'm ready for the good times\nI'm ready for the good times\nNow that I'm not alone\n\nCause,
